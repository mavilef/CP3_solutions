My problem solutions from Competitive Programming 3 by Steve Halim.

Each problem is organized in a folder following the naming convention:
uva_<number_of_problem>_<name_of_problem_with_underscore>

Note: the number of problem does not include leading zero's

On each folder there are three archives:
	- <name_of_problem_with_underscore>.<language suffix> :
		My solution for the problem.
	- test:
		The input test proposed in the problem, or proposed by me.
		If more than one test is present, will add a suffix with
		underscore and the number(eg. test_1, test_2,...).
	- expected_out:
		The output expected to the test archive(s).
		If more than one test is present, will add the corresponding
		suffix in expected_out too(eg. expected_out_1, ...).

TODO:
	- For each problem include a pdf containing the problem statement from 
	uva.
